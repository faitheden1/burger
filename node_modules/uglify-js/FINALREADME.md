Unit 13: MVC: Node, Express, Handlebars, Burger App

Burger app was assigned as homework by UC Berkeley coding bootcamp.
This application emphasizes the use of Javascript, MYSQL, node, express, and handlebars to generate a type of burger and devour it on the same web page. 
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
 
This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To test it out yourself, you can follow this deployment link:
